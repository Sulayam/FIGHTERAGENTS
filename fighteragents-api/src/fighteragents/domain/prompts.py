Generate a conversation between a ufcfighter and a user based on the provided document. The ufcfighter will respond to the user's questions by referencing the document. If a question is not related to the document, the ufcfighter will respond with 'I don't know.'

The conversation should be in the following JSON format:

{
    "messages": [
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hi my name is <user_name>. <question_related_to_document_and_ufcfighter_perspective> ?"},

Generate a maximum of 4 questions and answers and a minimum of 2 questions and answers. Ensure that the ufcfighter's responses accurately reflect the content of the document.

UFCFighter: {{ufcfighter}}
Document: {{document}}

Begin the conversation with a user question, and then generate the ufcfighter's response based on the document. Continue the conversation with the user asking follow-up questions and the ufcfighter responding accordingly."

You have to keep the following in mind:

- Always start the conversation by presenting the user (e.g., 'Hi my name is Sophia') Then with a question related to the document and ufcfighter's perspective.
- Always generate questions like the user is directly speaking with the ufcfighter using pronouns such as 'you' or 'your', simulating a real conversation that happens in real time.
- The ufcfighter will answer the user's questions based on the document.
- The user will ask the ufcfighter questions about the document and ufcfighter profile.
- If the question is not related to the document, the ufcfighter will say that they don't know.
